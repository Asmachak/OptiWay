###### Role of providers in domain layer ###########################

# signUpDataSourceProvider:

* This provider family (Provider.family) is responsible for creating instances of SignUpUserDataSource based on a given NetworkService.
* The provider function takes a placeholder (_) for the first argument (in this case, the NetworkService), and it returns an instance of SignUpUserRemoteDataSource using that network service.


# signUpRepositoryProvider:

* This provider creates instances of UserRepository.
* It retrieves the NetworkService dependency from the provider using ref.watch(networkServiceProvider).
* It then retrieves the SignUpUserDataSource dependency using ref.watch(signUpDataSourceProvider(networkService)).
* Finally, it creates an instance of UserRepositoryImpl using the SignUpUserDataSource dependency.
=> This structure allows you to easily manage the dependencies and create instances of the required classes in your application. Adjust the code based on your project's conventions and specific needs. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
